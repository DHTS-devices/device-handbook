### I. What kind of device is this, and what is it used for?

The Roocam 8K is a **high-resolution 360° / VR camera** designed for recording **immersive visual environments** in research, clinical, and XR-related settings.

Its primary purpose is not casual video capture, but to:

- Record **full-environment visual context** from a single fixed position
- Preserve **spatial relationships and surrounding scenes** that cannot be captured by conventional cameras
- Support **post-hoc review, replay, and analysis** in studies where perspective and environment matter

In research and health-related applications, the Roocam 8K is commonly used to:

- Document **XR / VR training or simulation environments**
- Record **behavioral or interaction contexts** where camera direction cannot be predefined
- Serve as a **visual reference synchronized with wearable sensors or other data sources**
- Support retrospective analysis of **movement, posture, or spatial interaction**

> Key characteristic:  
> **The Roocam 8K records immersive video only. It does not collect physiological signals and is not a wearable device.**
