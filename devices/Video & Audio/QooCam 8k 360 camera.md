### I. Device Info

## webLink： https://www.kandaovr.com/support/qoocam-8k#support_detail_user_guide

The Qoocam 8K is a **high-resolution 360° / VR camera** designed for recording **immersive visual environments** in research, clinical, and XR-related settings.

Its primary purpose is not casual video capture, but to:

- Record **full-environment visual context** from a single fixed position
- Preserve **spatial relationships and surrounding scenes** that cannot be captured by conventional cameras
- Support **post-hoc review, replay, and analysis** in studies where perspective and environment matter

In research and health-related applications, the Roocam 8K is commonly used to:

- Document **XR / VR training or simulation environments**
- Record **behavioral or interaction contexts** where camera direction cannot be predefined
- Serve as a **visual reference synchronized with wearable sensors or other data sources**
- Support retrospective analysis of **movement, posture, or spatial interaction**


### II. data format
The Qoocam 8K produces **video data only**.
All data generated by the device consists of:

- **360° / immersive video files**
- Optional **embedded audio tracks**
- Basic **video metadata** (e.g., resolution, frame rate, timestamps)

The primary output format is:
- **MP4 video files** (H.264 / H.265, depending on recording settings)
Each recording session generates:
- One or more large video files stored on local media (e.g., SD card)
- No accompanying structured data files (e.g., CSV, JSON, or sensor logs)

---
#### Important notes on data structure
- The Qoocam 8K **does not generate tabular or time-series data**
- There are **no per-frame labels, annotations, or derived metrics**
- Any behavioral, spatial, or event-level information must be:
  - Annotated manually, or  
  - Derived during post-processing using external software
  - 64G build-in storage, and up to 256G SD card external
