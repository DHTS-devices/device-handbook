## Set Up

### 1.1 Power Check
- Insert **4 × AA batteries** 
  - Recommended:  (2000–2500 mAh)
- OR prepare a **USB power source** (power bank / wall adapter / laptop)

Best practice:  
For sessions longer than 2 hours, **use USB power** and keep batteries inside as backup.

---

### 1.2 Insert SD Card
- Use an **SD / SDHC / SDXC card**
- Insert card **before powering on**
- Recommended: ≥ 32 GB
- 
---

### 1.3 Physical Connections (Before Boot)
- Connect microphones to **XLR inputs**
- Plug in **headphones** for monitoring (recommended)
- Secure cables to avoid accidental unplugging

Do **not**:
- Hot-swap microphones during recording
- Enable phantom power yet (do it after boot)

---

## 2. Related Accessories 

### 2.1 Microphones
- Lavalier mic (interviews)
- Condenser mic (ambient / room sound)
- Shotgun mic (directional recording)

 Some microphones require **phantom power (48V)**.

---

### 2.2 Power Accessories
- High-capacity AA rechargeable batteries
- USB power bank (10,000 mAh or higher recommended)
- USB wall adapter

---

### 2.3 Storage & Data
- Extra SD cards (labeled)
- SD card reader for fast data transfer

---

### 2.4 Monitoring & Mounting
- Closed-back headphones (to prevent feedback)
- Tripod or table stand (optional but helpful)

---

## 3. How to Start Recording (Step-by-Step)

This section describes the **standard recording workflow** used in most research studies.

---

### 3.1 Power On
- Press and hold the **Power** button in the bottom
- Wait for the touchscreen interface to load

---

### 3.2 Select Recording Mode
On first boot (or via menu), choose:

- **Field Mode** (recommended for research)
  - Independent tracks
  - Full control over inputs

> Use Field Mode for 90% of interviews, observations, and experiments.

---

### 3.3 Enable Inputs
- Confirm which XLR inputs are active
- Disable unused channels to reduce noise and file clutter

---

### 3.4 Set Gain Levels
- Ask participant to speak at **normal volume**
- Adjust gain so peaks stay **below clipping**
- Avoid red indicators

Target:
- Average level: -12 to -6 dB
- Peaks: never hit 0 dB

---

### 3.5 Enable Phantom Power (If Needed)
- Enable **48V** only for microphones that require it
- Double-check correct channel selection

⚠️ Phantom power significantly increases battery drain.

---

### 3.6 Headphone Monitoring
- Plug in headphones
- Confirm:
  - Audio is present
  - No distortion
  - Correct channel mapping

---

### 3.7 Start Recording
- Press the **Record** button
- Confirm:
  - Timer is running
  - Track meters are moving

Optional but recommended:
- Do a **hand clap or verbal marker** at start for syncing with video or other sensors

---

### 3.8 Stop & Save
- Press **Stop**
- Wait for file write to complete
- Do **not** power off immediately

---

### 3.9 Post-Session Check
- Verify audio playback briefly
- Note any issues (noise, interruption, battery warning)
- Power off safely

---

## Physical Controls & Interfaces (Quick Orientation)

This section explains the **main physical buttons, knobs, ports, and switches** on the Zoom H8, focusing on what users see and touch first.

---

## Front Panel Buttons

### HOME Button

---

## Input Gain Knobs (Numbered)

Each rotary knob controls the **input gain** for a specific channel.

- Knobs are labeled with **numbers (1–4)**
- Each number corresponds to an **XLR input**
- Turning clockwise increases gain
- Turning counterclockwise decreases gain

### What the Numbers Mean
- **1–4** = Physical XLR input channels
- Channel numbers must match:
  - Microphone connection
  - Recording track
  - Phantom power settings

 Best practice:
- Adjust gain while the participant speaks at a normal volume
- Avoid red clipping indicators on screen

---

## Microphone Capsule Inputs (Top)
