## How to Use

### Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

### 1. Pre-Test Preparation

- Ensure the device is fully charged.
- Confirm Bluetooth is enabled (if using mobile app).
- Verify sufficient unused test strips are available.
- Ask participant to:
  - Avoid eating or drinking (except water) 10–15 minutes before test.
  - Avoid brushing teeth or using mouthwash immediately prior.
  - Sit calmly for a few minutes before sampling.

---

### 2. Device Setup

1. Power on the MX3 analyzer.
2. Open the MX3 mobile application (if using app sync).
3. Select or create participant profile.
4. Confirm Bluetooth pairing (if applicable).

---

### 3. Sample Collection

1. Remove a new saliva test strip from packaging.
2. Place the absorbent end of the strip under the participant’s tongue.
3. Hold in place for the required time (follow manufacturer guidance).
4. Ensure strip is adequately saturated.

Use only new, single-use strips.

---

### 4. Measurement

1. Insert the saliva strip into the analyzer.
2. Wait for the device to process the reading.
3. Result will display on screen within seconds.

---

### 5. Data Recording

If using mobile app:

- Data automatically syncs via Bluetooth.
- Verify reading appears in participant profile.
- Add optional notes (e.g., temperature, training session, symptoms).

If not using app:

- Manually record hydration score in lab log.
- Save timestamp and participant ID.

---

### 6. Post-Test Procedure

- Remove and discard used strip (bio-waste).
- Wipe analyzer surface if needed.
- Power off device if no further tests planned.
- Return device to storage case.

---

## Frequency of Use

- Recommended before practice, training, or heat exposure.
- Can be used multiple times per day if needed.
- Avoid excessive back-to-back testing without rest.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| No reading | Insufficient saliva | Recollect sample |
| Error message | Strip misaligned | Reinsert strip |
| No Bluetooth sync | App not paired | Reconnect device |
| Inconsistent readings | Recent food/drink intake | Wait 10–15 min and retest |

---

## Quality Control Recommendations

- Test at consistent time of day when possible.
- Maintain similar pre-test conditions.
- Track environmental heat exposure for context.
- Log hydration trends rather than single readings.
